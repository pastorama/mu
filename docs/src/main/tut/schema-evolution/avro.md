### A: Add new non-optional field in the request

Request: Provide default value to the new field.

```scala
case class Request(a: String, b: Int)
case class NewRequest(a: String, b: Int, c: Boolean = true)
```

### B: Add new optional field in the request

Request: This is just another case of the previous scenario. The solutions could be to provide a default value, that presumably could be None/null.

### C: Add item to a coproduct in the request

Request: No action required

```scala
case class Request(a: Int :+: String :+: CNil)
case class NewRequest(a: Int :+: String :+: Boolean :+: CNil)
```

### D: Remove item to a coproduct in the request

Request: The only way to deal with this situation is considering this as a change of type, see next case.

```scala
case class Request(a: Int :+: String :+: CNil)
case class NewRequest(b: String :+: CNil = Coproduct[String :+: CNil](""))
```

### E: Replace item in a coproduct in the request

Request: If the type is just replaced, it will work while the passed value is one of the types in common between the previous coproduct and the new one.

```scala
case class Request(a: Int :+: String :+: CNil)
case class NewRequest(a: Int :+: Boolean :+: CNil)
```

It will work if the request is:
```scala
Request(a = Coproduct[Int :+: String :+: CNil](10))
```

and it will fail if the request is:
```scala
Request(a = Coproduct[Int :+: String :+: CNil]("Hi"))
```

### F: Change type of an existing field in the request

Request: It's is impossible to deal with a type swapping if we maintain the same name of the field. So the solution is considering this replacement as a combination of removing the old field/type, and adding a new field with the new type with a default value.

```scala
case class Request(a: String, b: Int)
case class NewRequest(a: String, c: Boolean = true)
```

### G: Rename field in the request

Request: Renaming a field is a particular case of creating a field with the new name and default value, and remove the old one, that will be ignored if old clients pass it.

```scala
case class Request(a: String, b: Int)
case class NewRequest(a: String, c: Int = 0)
```

### H: Remove field in the request

Request: No action required. But note that the value will be ignored when old clients include it in the request.

```scala
case class Request(a: String, b: Int)
case class NewRequest(a: String)
```

### I: Add new non-optional field in the response

Response: No action required. Old clients will ignore the value of the new field.

```scala
case class Response(a: String, b: Int)
case class NewResponse(a: String, b: Int, c: Boolean)
```

### J: Add new optional field in the response

Response: This is a just a particular case of the previous scenario.

### K: Add item to a coproduct in the response

Response: Obviously, it fails when the value is the new item. So the solution is providing a default value to the old coproduct and creating a new field with the new coproduct.

```scala
case class Response(a: Int :+: String :+: CNil)
case class NewResponse(
      a: Int :+: String :+: CNil = Coproduct[Int :+: String :+: CNil](0),
      b: Int :+: String :+: Boolean :+: CNil)
```

### L: Remove item to a coproduct in the response

Response: No action required.

```scala
case class Response(a: Int :+: String :+: CNil)
case class NewResponse(a: Int :+: CNil)
```

### M: Replace item in a coproduct in the response

Response: As long as the value of the coproduct belongs to the previous version, the old client should be able to accept the response as valid.

```scala
case class Response(a: Int :+: String :+: CNil)
case class NewResponse(a: Int :+: Boolean :+: CNil)
```

### N: Change type of an existing field in the response

Response: It requires to provide a default value to the previous type, and to create a new field with the new type.

```scala
case class Response(a: String, b: Int)
case class NewResponse(a: String, b: Int = 123, c: Boolean)
```

### O: Rename field in the response

Response: It requires to remain the previous name/type with a default value and to add a new field with the same type.

```scala
case class Response(a: String, b: Int)
case class NewResponse(a: String, b: Int = 123, c: Int)
```

### P: Remove field in the response

Response: This evolution should never happen. Only under the special case that the old response has a default value for the field we want to drop, then this operation is feasible, just removing the field in the new version of the response.

```scala
case class Response(a: String, b: Int = 123)
case class NewResponse(a: String)
```
